1. See online instructions for downloading the MATLAB plugins (MIJI, PSFGenerator, and DeconvolutionLab2) from EPFL Biomedical Imaging Group

2. Add folder with code "Add to Path" -> "Selected Folders and Subfolders" in MATLAB

3. Move to the directory with the tiff file to be analyzed

4. run command "mijistartup" in Command Window and follow prompts

5. After MIJI loads, use Bio-Formats plugin to open tiff file so channels are separated

6. For each color channel:
- Image > Stacks > Z Project ... > Max Intensity > save as "channel_zstack.tif" (_ either 1,2, or 3)
- then, on the compressed 2D channel image: Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur > 1 (use value of 1 so that spots right next to each other are still distinct)
- Process > Find Maxima > check off Strict and Exclude edge maxima > use Preview point selection to play with the Prominence value parameter to pick up all spots (it is okay to pick up noise, since they will be discarded from my code, but you should try to pick up all the spots you see as much as possible)
- with the spots selected, Ctrl + M, type getCoords_ (_ being 1,2, or 3) in Command Window
- reopen blue channel z-stack image and duplicate the z-stack, Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur > 2 > Yes (use value of 2 because we want to blend the blue blob of the nucleus, we are not prioritizing being able to resolve spots, a value of 2 is better for thresholding than 1), Image > Type > 8-bit (FIJI's Threshold function only works on 8-bit images), Image > Adjust > Threshold > adjust top scroll until the white resembles slightly larger than the nuclei (compare to duplicated z-stack of original blue channel) > Set > Ok > Apply > DESELECT Calculate threshold for each image > Ok > save as "binarymask.tif"

7. run command "procedure" in Command Window (the totalcelldata variable represents the results, where each row is a cell and column order information is documented in code)
